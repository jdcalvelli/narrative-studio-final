Lt Dover "Yo Yo Ducksly!

Emperor Ducksly "Quackcelsior Lieutenant Dover!

Lt Dover "We're coming up on the end of our journey Ducksly. You excited?

Emperor Ducksly "Am I excited to be one of the first to discover what lies beyond the Edge?

Emperor Ducksly "To see how infinite creation sprouts from infinite nothingness? 

Emperor Ducksly "To pass a boundry that no mortal creature since time immemorial?

Lt Dover "Uh...

Emperor Ducksly "The place where life's very questions become infinitely irrelevant?

Lt Dover "Yes?

Emperor Ducksly "Absolutely I'm excited. 

Lt Dover "Well that's good to hear.

Emperor Ducksly "Quack! Qu-Quack! I have something exciting to share!

Lt Dover "Oh man, two and a half quacks. Must be crazy. 

Emperor Ducksly "The Captain shared with a me a secret so secret that not even Officer Veldspar knows it!

Lt Dover "Um yeah?

Emperor Ducksly "Quack! Yes! I only learned about it through my experiments. 

Emperor Ducksly "Regardless, I've finally achieved some level of respect and recognition from the Captain that not even J.V could achieve!

Lt Dover "What is this weird obession with J.V you have?

Emperor Ducksly "Oh please. It's not to do with J.V, I just wished that Captain Baha would recognize the talent that I had. 

Lt Dover "Sure, ok. I just figured it was like some kinda deep seeded rivalry. You're just a brown-noser. Or I guess brown-beaker.

Lt Dover "So what now?

Emperor Ducksly "How do you mean?

Lt Dover "Well, You've got the sacred trust of Captain Baha in the form of this secret you know. 
    Do you feel complete?
    
Emperor Ducksly "Quack! I- Hmm. I suppose... Quack!

Lt Dover "Oh my..

Emperor Ducksly "I haven't even stopped to consider what I would do afterwards.

*It's ok if that's all you wanted to do!
~B_Duck_relCount ++
*I think you want to hang it over everyone that you know the Captain's secret.
~B_Duck_relCount --

-Emperor Ducksly "Honestly, a part of me never really thought something like this would happen.

Emperor Ducksly "Lieutenant Dover, you truly have some wise words. You would have a welcome place within the Quacking emperium. 

Lt Dover "Aw shucks you oversized duck.
