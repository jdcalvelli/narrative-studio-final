//TORI NOTE: I'VE JUST GONE THROUGH AND SET UP THESE POST-CONVO VARIABLE DIVERTS, ALTER AS THE SCENE REQUIRES. 

Lt Dover "Yo Yo, Ducksly! #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Quackcelsior, Lieutenant Dover! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "We're coming up on the end of our journey. You excited? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Am I excited to be one of the first beings to discover what lies beyond the Edge? #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "To see how infinite creation sprouts from infinite nothingness? #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "To pass a boundary that no mortal creature since time immemorial has ever done before? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Uh... #Dover
// Emperor Ducksly "The place where life's very questions become infinitely irrelevant?
Lt Dover "I'll take that as a yes? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Absolutely, positutely. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Well, that's very good to hear. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I have news that you might be thrilled to hear. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Oh, and what's that? #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "It would appear that J.V. and I have come to a bit of a truce. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "You're lying. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "I would never, Dover. I would simply "omit", never lie. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "How did that come to be? #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Mutually assured prank-struction. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "That is the stupidest think I've ever heard...but... #Ducksly

* I'm glad you've buried the hatchet, so to speak. #Dover
    <- D3_improveDJV
* Now would be the perfect time to take her down. #Dover 
    <- D3_worsenDJV

- Emperor Ducksly "Lieutenant Dover, you truly have some wise words. You would have a welcome place within the Quacking Emperium. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Aw shucks, you oversized duck. #Dover
Lt Dover "See you at the Edge. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "QUACK! Qu-Quack! I have something exciting to share! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Oh man, two and a half quacks. Must be crazy. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "The Captain shared with a me a secret sooo secret that not even Officer Veldspar knows it! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "You don't say? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "QUACK! Yes! #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I only learned about it through my experiments that the Captain didn't even want me to complete. #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "Regardless, I've finally achieved some level of respect and recognition from him that not even J.V. could hope achieve! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "What is with this weird obession you have with J.V.? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Oh, please. It has nothing to do with J.V. #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I just wished that Captain Baha would recognize the talent that I had. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Sure, ok. I just figured it was like some kinda deep-seated rivalry. #Dover
Lt Dover "You're just a brown-noser...or I guess brown-beaker. #Dover
Lt Dover "So...what now? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "How do you mean? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Well, you've got the 'sacred trust' of Captain Baha in the form of this secret that only 'you' know. #Dover
Lt Dover "Do you feel complete? #Dover
    
Emperor Ducksly "QUACK! I - hmm. I suppose... QUACK! #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I'd never stopped to consider what I would do afterwards... #Ducksly

* It's ok if that's all you wanted to do! #Dover
    ~ B_Duck_relCount ++
* Sounds like you want to hang this secret over everyone. #Dover
