Cpt Baha "Yes, the air around the ship is certainly jubilant to say the least. #Baha
Cpt Baha "Feeling some of that joy myself. #Baha

Cpt Baha "J.V. didn't take my call. #Baha
Cpt Baha "I worry I've been too dependent on her. #Baha
Cpt Baha "Pushed her away... #Baha

Lt Dover "Pushed, pulled, a group effort really. #Dover 

Cpt Baha "There's not much time left, I feel I've done her a disservice, bringing her all the way out here. #Baha

    Lt Dover "I know you've known eachother a long time, but I think it's pretty apparent you're more than just co-workers at this point. #Dover

Cpt Baha "I wish I could speak to her one last time...before - #Baha 
Lt Dover "Before the Edge? #Dover

Cpt Baha "Yes...the Edge. #Baha

Cpt Baha "I just spoke with Ducksly{day1_sceneChoice == true: again}...they still didn't get their checklist in. #Baha

Lt Dover "Oop. I hope everything was sorted out? #Dover 

Cpt Baha "More or less... #Baha

Lt Dover "I'm sensing there's more to this? #Dover 

Cpt Baha "I told them something, and I think they were more excited than they should be. #Baha

* Oh? What was it? #Dover 
* You mind sharing? No pressure. #Dover 

- Cpt Baha "It...doesn't really matter. I suppose it was weird to have such a 'heart-to-heart' moment with them. #Baha

Lt Dover "Between you and Ducksly? Did not see that coming. #Dover 

Cpt Baha "I think the thing that surprised me most was just how understanding of the whole situation they were, despite their oddly joyous reaction. #Baha

Lt Dover "I've heard a lot of things about Ducksly, them being empathetic is not one of them. #Dover

Cpt Baha "(Chuckles) I think they'll find some way to rub this in J.V's face a bit. #Baha

* What's J.V. have to do with this? #Dover 
* He would do something like that. #Dover 

- Cpt Baha "Ducksly has always had this weird one-sided competition with J.V over gaining the most favor from me. #Baha
Cpt Baha "Tell me something, Lieutenant Dover: If you were in my boots, what would you do with Ducksly? #Baha

* Ducksly might just need a friend. #Dover

* I think they only care about personal glory. Best to ignore them. #Dover

- Cpt Baha "You really think that? #Baha

Lt Dover "I do. #Dover 
Lt Dover "Ducksly is definitely a special character, with their own quirks for sure. #Dover 

Cpt Baha "Thank you, Dover. I've truly appreciated our time together. #Baha

Lt Dover "Aw shucks, Captain! You're gonna make me blush! #Dover 

Cpt Baha "See you on the Bridge to meet the Edge. #Baha

Lt Dover "Looking forward to it, Captain. #Dover
