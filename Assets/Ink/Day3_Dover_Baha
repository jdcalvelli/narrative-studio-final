Lt Dover "Yo Captain! We've almost reached the Edge! Are you excited?

Cpt Baha "Yes the air around the ship is certainly jubilant to say the least. 

Lt Dover "So what's up Captain?

=== D3_B_DB === //Day 2, JV spoke to Ducksly

Cpt Baha " I just spoke with Ducksly again...because they still didn't get his checklist in.

Lt Dover "Oop. I hope everything was sorted out.

Cpt Baha "More or less.

Lt Dover "I'm sensing there's more to this?

Cpt Baha "I told themm something, and I think they were more excited than they should be.

*Oh what was it?
*You mind sharing? No pressure.

-Cpt Baha "It doesn't really matter. I guess it was weird having such an intiment moment with them.

Lt Dover "Huh, You and Ducksly? Never would've seen that coming.

Cpt Baha "I think the thing that surprised me was just how understanding of the whole situation they were, despite their reaction. 

Lt Dover "I've heard a lot of things about Ducksly, empathetic is not one of them.

Cpt Baha "part of me thinks though that they'll find some way to rub this in J.V's face.

*What's JV have to do with this?
*He would do something like that.

-Cpt Baha "Ducksly has always had this weird one-sided competition with J.V over gaining the most favor from me.

Cpt Baha "Tell me something Lieutenant Dover: If you were in my position, what would you do with Ducksly?

Lt Dover "Me? Why do you care what I think?

Cpt Baha "If I didn't care what you think I wouldn't come to you and talk to you like this.
Lt Dover "Hmm.

*Ducksly looks like they just needs a friend.
~ B_Duck_relCount ++
*I think they only care about personal glory. Best to ignore them.
~ B_Duck_relCount --

-Cpt Baha "You really think that?

Lt Dover "I do. 

Lt Dover "Ducksly is definitely a special character. With their quirks for sure.

Cpt Baha "Thank you Dover. I've truly appreciated our time togehter. 

Lt Dover "Aw shucks Captain! You're gonna make me blush!
