//SFX: connection, line picking up

Officer JV "Dove! You got a second? #JV

Lt Dover "Hmm, let me see.. #Dover

Lt Dover "... #Dover

Lt Dover "Yup looks like I can squeeze you in. #Dover

Officer JV "Yeah? You got jokes? #JV

Officer JV "I'll only need a minute, I promise. Just wanted to vent about something. #JV

Lt Dover "Oh No! What's wrong? #Dover

Officer JV "You already know. #JV

Lt Dover "Do I? #Dover

Officer JV "Baha. He didn't answer me! #JV

*Oh no! How could he! #Dover
*Captain's probably just a busy guy. #Dover

-Officer JV "All I'm saying is that the Captain should always be on call for his crew. #JV

Lt Dover "There will be other chances to call him Baha Blast. #Dover

Officer JV "(Groans)You pass up the gig of a lifetime so you can stay on the ship of your favorite captain, the least he could do is answer. #JV 

Lt Dover "Hey now he just didn't answer this one time, it's hardly the end of the world. #Dover

Officer JV "It's not just this one time though #JV 

Lt Dover "Oh? #Dover

Officer JV "Ever since we left on this mission he's been such a hardass. #JV 

Lt Dover "To be honest I wouldn't want to be in the Captain's shoes. #Dover

Officer JV "(chuckling)Yeah you'd look like a clown in them. #JV

Officer JV "But that's not all. We used ot be really close but now it's like he hardly wants to talk. #JV 

Lt Dover "I'm sure you guys find time to chat. #Dover

Officer JV "We do! And when we do it's great! But just getting him to chat is such a struggle now. #JV 

Officer JV "I just want us to go back to being our little goon squad. #JV 

Lt Dover "Hmm #Dover

*Sometimes, people drift apart. Might be a sign to let go.
-> D1_JV_DistanceBaha
*You should tell him how you feel.

Officer JV "You really think so? #JV 

Lt Dover "We're coming up on the literal end of everything. Why not? #Dover

Officer JV "I guess I would just feel bad. #JV 

Lt Dover "Don't! It happens. Not that you have to be mean. But you don't have to keep trying if he's not. #Dover

Officer JV "That means I won't get to hear his bad writing (chuckles). #JV 

Officer JV "But maybe you're right. Thanks Doverino! #JV

Officer JV "That potentially creates conflict, so that's a big yikes for me. #JV 

Lt Dover "So? #Dover

Officer JV "Did you not just hear me say- #JV

Lt Dover "I know what you said but we're about to reach the end of everything. Now's the perfect time to break bread. #Dover

Officer JV "Hmm... #JV

Lt Dover "How about this: What if when we reach the edge, and all that's there is a blank void inhabited by an incompressible space squid monster. #Dover

Lt Dover "You wanna die on bad terms with the Captain in that scenario? #Dover

Officer JV "You think there's a giant space squid monster? #JV 

Lt Dover "What? No, it was... That's not the point J.V. #Dover

Officer JV "No you're right. If there is a space squid monster, Baha and I will challenge it head on together. #JV 

Officer JV "Thanks Doves, I appreciate it!
