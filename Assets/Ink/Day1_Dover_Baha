Lt Dover "Guess I'll see how the Captain is doing. #Dover

//Dover patches themselves to Captain Baha

Cpt Baha "Dover. Thanks for picking up. I hope I'm not taking you away from your responsibilities. #Baha

Lt Dover "No need to apologize Captain! Not much going on over here. #Dover

Cpt Baha "I'm sure. #Baha.

//Baha looks unsure

//A beat
Lt Dover "Everything ok Cap? #Dover

Cpt Baha "Of course...You know how it is. Everyone's getting their Pre-arrival checks in. #Baha

Lt Dover "Oh for sure, I can hear people running around. #Dover

Lt Dover "Of course, because you can hear everything through the coms. #Baha

*Oh No I can just hear them outside my door... #Dover

*That's right. I hear everything from my lair! #Dover

//a moment of silence

-Cpt Baha "I'm sure you already know I talked to Ducksly not to long ago. #Baha

Lt Dover "Yeah! How'd that go? they mentioned urgent business. #Dover

Lt Dover "Hard to tell if something is acutally serious with that one sometimes. #Dover

Cpt Baha "It was about his checklist. #Baha

Cpt Baha "Apparently he's got too many experiments going on to actually start on his checklist. #Baha

Lt Dover "Oh yeah they've been studying our bodies or something right? #Dover

Cpt Baha "You knew about them? #Baha

Lt Dover "... #Dover

Cpt Baha "Either way... I shouldn't have to ask my science officer to do his job. #Baha

*Wait. Don't their experiments kinda count as health check ups? #Dover
->Wait

*Well, this is your ship Captain. You word is law. #Dover
->Well

=== Wait ===
Cpt Baha "How do you mean? #Baha

Lt Dover "Well, like I said, they've been studying the conditions of our bodies. #Dover

Cpt Baha "Mhmm. #Baha

Lt Dover "And that means if something was wrong with one of our bodies they would've already notified you. #Dover

Cpt Baha "Right. #Baha

Lt Dover "So doesn't that imply that you're checking up on the patients health condition as well? #Dover

Oh. #Baha
