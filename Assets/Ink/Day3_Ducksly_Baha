Emperor Ducksly "Oh, Quackcelsior Captain! What can I help you with today? #Ducklsy

Cpt Baha "Ducksly, I wanted to check in and see how your checklist is going? You're the only person left that I'm missing confirmation from. #Baha 

Emperor Ducksly "Oh, about that. I actually wanted to talk to you - #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Ducksly, I really just want to get to the point. We'll be arriving soon and want to make sure on the crew is ok. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "I will say, Captain, my experiments have shed light on something... troubling. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "What do you mean?

Emperor Ducksly "I...Are you aware to the condition of your health Captain? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "How did you-

Emperor Ducksly "I retrieved biological samples from each crewmate as part of my experiments. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Ducksly do I want to know what that means?

Emperor Ducksly "It was quite easy to get actually. Some I got when they came to the medbay for checks. Others I simply went to waste disposal and- #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Thank you Ducksly, that's enough. 

Emperor Ducksly "Quack...Have you known Captain. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "I have...Part of the reason I accepted this job.

Emperor Ducksly "I'm sorry Captain. I'm sure I don't need to tell you how much time you have left. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Won't really matter soon will it?

Emperor Ducksly "I suppose not. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Captain...Could I ask a question? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Sure, what is it Ducksly?

Emperor Ducksly "Does Officer Veldspar know? Is this why you two are so close? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "I don't know how many times I have to tell you this Ducksly. J.V and I have known each other for quite some time before we took this mission. 

Emperor Ducksly "Does she know? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "She doesn't. I'd like to keep it that way. Can I trust you Ducksly?

Emperor Ducksly "Quack! Quackcelsior, Captain you honor me! Of course! #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Ducksly I'm serious.

Emperor Ducksly "My bill is sealed Captain! #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "And get me your checklist dammit. Baha out.

Emperor Ducksly "It's come to my attention that our goals were much more closely aligned that we anticipated. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Ducksly... #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Wait Captain, please let me explain. #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I promise you Sir, everything will make sense. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Spit it out, then. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "The checklist you assigned me was to make sure everyone was psychologically and physically sound.#Ducksly

Cpt Baha "OK? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Well my experiments are centered around just that! #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I compared my notes and they were practically reporting the same thing. #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I can transcibe everything into the checklist in a few hours. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Please do. #Baha
Cpt Baha "And well done. #Baha

===B_Duck_Trouble
Emperor Ducksly "I found that my experiments provided better data, so I will be providing my research findings instead. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Ducksly...WHERE is your checklist? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Oh, applogies, Captian. Something must've happened with the patch. I shall repeat myself - #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "I heard what you said, Ducksly. #Baha 
Cpt Baha "I gave you an order. You ignored it. #Baha

Emperor Ducklsy "No no no Captain like I said the expri- #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "I don't care that your experiments provide more data! #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "But isn't that the whole point #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Ducksly let me put this as succinctly as possible: When your captain gives you orders, you follow them. #Baha

Cpt Baha "Do you understand me Ducksly? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "... #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Yes Captain. #Ducksly
