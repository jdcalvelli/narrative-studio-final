Emperor Ducksly "I would say one more thing, Captain. #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "My experiments have shed light on something... troubling. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "What do you mean? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "I...Are you aware of the condition of your health, Captain? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "What did you - #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "I retrieved biological samples from each crewmate as part of my experiments. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Do I... #Baha
    //want to know what that means? #Baha
// Emperor Ducksly "It was quite easy to get actually. Some I got when they came to the medbay for checks. Others I simply went to waste disposal and- #Ducksly
Cpt Baha "Thank you, Ducksly. That's enough. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "QUACK...did you know, Captain? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "It's...part of the reason I accepted this job. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "I'm sorry, Captain. #Baha
Emperor Ducksly "I'm sure I don't need to tell you how much time you have left. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Won't really matter soon, will it? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "I suppose not. #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "Captain...could I ask a final question? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Sure, what is it Ducksly? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Does Officer Veldspar know? Is this why you two are so close? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "I don't know how many times I have to tell you this, Ducksly. J.V and I have known each other for quite some time before we ever took on this mission. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "But, does she know? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "She doesn't. I'd like to keep it that way. Can I trust you, Ducksly? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "QUACK! Captain, you honor me! Of course! #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Ducksly, I'm serious. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "My bill is sealed, Captain! Quackcelsior! #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Get me your checklist, dammit. Baha out. #Baha

Cpt Baha "Ducksly... #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Wait, Captain, please let me explain. #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I promise you, Sir, everything will make sense. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Spit it out, then. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "The checklist you assigned me was to make sure everyone was psychologically and physically sound.#Ducksly

Cpt Baha "OK? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Well my experiments are centered around just that! #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I compared my notes and they were practically reporting the same thing. #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I can transcibe everything into the checklist in a few hours. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Please do. #Baha
Cpt Baha "And well done. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "QUACK...thank you! #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Ducksly...WHERE is your checklist? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Oh, applogies, Captian. Something must've happened with the patch. I shall repeat myself - #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "I heard what you said, Ducksly. #Baha 
Cpt Baha "I gave you an order. You ignored it. #Baha

Emperor Ducklsy "No, no, no, Captain. It's as I said, the experi - #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "I don't care that your experiments provide more data! #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "But isn't the data the whole point? #Ducksly
