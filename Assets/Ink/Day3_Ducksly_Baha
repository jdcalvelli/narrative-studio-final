Emperor Ducksly "Oh, Captain! What can I help you with today? #Ducklsy

Cpt Baha "Ducksly, I wanted to check in and see how your checklist is going? You're the only person left that I'm missing one from.

Emperor Ducksly "Oh about that. I actually wanted to talk to you about it!

Cpt Baha "Ducksly I really just want to get to the point. We'll be arriving soon and I really want to make sure on the crew is ok.

Cpt Baha "You have put your experiments on pause while you do your checklist right?

Emperor Ducksly "I will say Captain, my experiments have shed light on something... troubling.

Cpt Baha "What do you mean?

Emperor Ducksly "I...Are you aware to the condition of your health Captain?

Cpt Baha "How did you-

Emperor Ducksly "I retrieved biological samples from each crewmate as part of my experiments.

Cpt Baha "Ducksly do I want to know what that means?

Emperor Ducksly "It was quite easy to get actually. Some I got when they came to the medbay for checks. Others I simply went to waste disposal and-

Cpt Baha "Thank you Ducksly, that's enough. 

Emperor Ducksly "Quack...Have you known Captain.

Cpt Baha "I have...Part of the reason I accepted this job.

Emperor Ducksly "I'm sorry Captain. I'm sure I don't need to tell you how much time you have left. 

Cpt Baha "Won't really matter soon will it?

Emperor Ducksly "I suppose not. 

Emperor Ducksly "Captain...Could I ask a question?

Cpt Baha "Sure, what is it Ducksly?

Emperor Ducksly "Does Officer Veldspar know? Is this why you two are so close?

Cpt Baha "I don't know how many times I have to tell you this Ducksly. J.V and I have known each other for quite some time before we took this mission. 

Emperor Ducksly "Does she know?

Cpt Baha "She doesn't. I'd like to keep it that way. Can I trust you Ducksly?

Emperor Ducksly "Quack! Quackcelsior, Captain you honor me! Of course!

Cpt Baha "Ducksly I'm serious.

Emperor Ducksly "My bill is sealed Captain!

Cpt Baha "And get me your checklist dammit. Baha out.

Emperor Ducksly "It's come to my attention that our goals were much closer alligned that we anticipated. 

Cpt Baha "Ducksly...

Emperor Ducksly "Wait Captain, please let me explain. 

Cpt Baha "Hmm.

Emperor Ducksly "I promise you Sir, everything will make sesne. 

Cpt Baha "Ducksly, I'm begging you, please spit it out.

Emperor Ducksly "The checklist you assigned to me was to make sure everyone was psychologically and physically sound.

Cpt Baha "OK?

Emperor Ducksly "Well my experiments are centered around just that!

Emperor Ducksly "I looked over the checklist and I looked over my research notes and they were practically reporting the same thing. 

Cpt Baha "Ducksly... are you going to have the checklist done soon or not?

Emperor Ducksly "Yes sir, I can't transcibe everything into the checklist in a few hours.

Cpt Baha "please do.

Emperor Ducksly "I found that my experiments provided better data so I'd like to provide my research findings instead. 

Cpt Baha "Ducksly...Where is your checklist?

Emperor Ducksly "Oh I'm sorry Captian something must've happened with the patch. I said I-

Cpt Baha "I heard what you said Ducksly. I gave you an order. You ignored it.

Emperor Ducklsy "No no no Captain like I said the expri-

Cpt Baha "I don't care that your experiments provide more data!

Emperor Ducksly "But isn't that the whole point

Cpt Baha "Ducksly let me put this as succinctly as possible: When your captain gives you orders, you follow them. 

Cpt Baha "Do you understand me Ducksly?

Emperor Ducksly "... 

Emperor Ducksly "Yes Captain.
