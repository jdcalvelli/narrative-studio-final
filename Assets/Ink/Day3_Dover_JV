//Day 2: DOVER connects for a private conversation with JV.

//TORI NOTE: I'VE JUST GONE THROUGH AND SET UP THESE POST-CONVO VARIABLE DIVERTS, ALTER AS THE SCENE REQUIRES. 

Officer JV "Lieutenant Dover, This is Maintenance Officer July Veldspar, might I request a smidgen of your time?

Lt Dover "Ew. Why are you talking like that?

Officer JV "Hehe, sorry I was just in a silly-goofy mood.

Lt Dover "I can tell, what do you want?

Officer JV "Let me tell you about this exchange I just had with this fool Ducksly.

Lt Dover "Wow, usually Ducksly is the one complaining about you.

Officer JV "Yeah well I guess it's about time I do so.

Lt Dover "Alright, I got nothing else going on so feel free to splurge.

Officer JV "Well it appears we've gotten in a bit of a prank war.

Lt Dover "Woah! I didn't know they had it in them. 

Officer JV "That's what I thought too! 

Officer JV "Fortunately, they're messing with a prank master!

Officer JV "The downside is they've gotten big feathers now, they think they are also some prank master. 

Lt Dover "Will JV's title as prank master to the up-and-coming rookie Emperor Ducksly?!

Officer JV "...Dover... Please...Look at me. What do you see?

*A dweeb.
*Someone who's ego is almost as bloated as Ducksly's.

-Officer JV "Aha ha ha... Shut up. 

Lt Dover "You asked. I answered hehe. 

Officer JV "I guess I could let this go one. It would definitely liven up the ship a bit more. What do you think Dover?

*A good bit of prank banter never hurt anyone.
~JV_Duck_relCount ++
*Put them in their place. You are the prank god.
~JV_Duck_relCount --

-Officer JV "Mmm Yes, you're right. I "m starting to get some ideas Mwahahaha!

Officer JV "Thanks Dover!
