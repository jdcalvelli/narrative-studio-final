//Day 2: DOVER connects for a private conversation with JV.

Officer JV "Lieutenant Dover, this is Maintenance Officer July Veldspar, might I request a smidgen of your time? #JV

Lt Dover "Ew. Why are you talking like that? #Dover

Officer JV "Hehe, sorry I was just in a silly, goofy mood. #JV

Lt Dover "I can tell. What's up? #Dover

Officer JV "Let me tell you about this exchange I just had with this fool Ducksly. #JV

Lt Dover "Wow, usually Ducksly is the one complaining about you. #Dover

Officer JV "Yeah, well I guess it's about time it was my turn. #JV

Lt Dover "I got nothing else going on right now, splurge away. #Dover

Officer JV "It appears we've gotten in a bit of a prank war. #JV

Lt Dover "I didn't know they had it in them. #Dover

Officer JV "Same! #JV
Officer JV "They've got big feathers now, thinking they're some kind of prank master. #JV
Officer JV "Unfortunately for them, they're messing with the Vespira's champion prankster! #JV

Lt Dover ""Will J.V. lose her title as 'prank master' to the up-and-coming rookie Emperor Ducksly!?!" #Dover

Officer JV "...Dover... please...when you look at me, what do you see? #JV

* A dweeb. #Dover
* An ego is almost as bloated as Ducksly's. #Dover

- Officer JV "Oh hardy har... Shut up. #JV

Lt Dover "Hehe, you asked. I answered. #Dover

Officer JV "I guess I could be merciful and let this one go. #JV
Officer JV "It would definitely liven up the ship a bit. What do you think Dover? #JV

* A good-hearted bit of prank banter never hurt anyone. #Dover
    ~JV_Duck_relCount ++ //raise the JV & ducksly relationship by 1
* Put them in their place. You are the prank god. #Dover
    ~JV_Duck_relCount -- //lower the JV & ducksly relationship by 1

- Officer JV "Mmm yes, you're right. I'm starting to get some ideas...  #JV
Officer JV "Mwahahaha! #JV
Officer JV "Thanks, Dove! #JV

=== D3_JV_DB === //Day 2, JV spoke to Ducksly
Officer JV "Well, I needed to find my tools from Ducksly, but he didn't answer. #JV
Officer JV "And Baha is busy, so I'm assuming Ducksly's talking his ear off sooo...here I be. #JV

Lt Dover "Things OK with you? #Dover

Officer JV "Eh, yeah. We're getting closer to the Edge and it's just given me a lot to think about. #JV

Officer JV "Over the course of our misssion, I feel like...I don't know, everyone just sees me as this little silly quirky character on the ship. #JV

* You ARE just a silly, quirky character. #Dover
* You didn't just say silly and quirky in the same sentence. #Dover

- Officer JV "I don't mean to be this way. #JV

Lt Dover "Did someone say this to you? Do I need to beat them up? #Dover

Officer JV "I mean I guess if you want to punch on the Captain and Ducksly then go ahead. #JV

* Actually, let's rethink this. #Dover
* Bring it on... #Dover

- Officer JV "I'm retiring after this mission. #JV

Lt Dover "Woah. #Dover

Officer JV "I mean, so we really think society as we knew it will exist once we return. IF we return? #JV

Lt Dover "I don't know, that's above my paygrade. #Dover

Officer JV "I guess the question now is how do I break the news to Baha? #JV

* I think you should defintely find some time to sit down with him. #Dover
    ~ B_JV_relCount ++ //raise Baha and JV rel count by 1
* Don't tell him. Did he ever truly appreciate you? #Dover
    ~ B_JV_relCount -- //lower Baha and JV rel count by 1
    
- Officer JV "You really think so? #JV

Lt Dover "YoU rEaLlY tHiNk So? #Dover
Lt Dover "Why ask me what I think if your just gonna second guess what I think? #Dover

Officer JV "Sassyyyy! Fair enough. #JV
Officer JV "You've been a really good friend Dover. I'm so lucky to have you. #JV

Lt Dover "Oh man, I'd hug you if you were here. #Dover

//Officer JV "Give me a sec and I'll run over. 
Officer JV "Hug me on the Bridge when we meet the Edge? #JV

Lt Dover "Deal. #Dover
