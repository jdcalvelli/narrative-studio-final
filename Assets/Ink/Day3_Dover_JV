//Day 2: DOVER connects for a private conversation with JV.

//TORI NOTE: I'VE JUST GONE THROUGH AND SET UP THESE POST-CONVO VARIABLE DIVERTS, ALTER AS THE SCENE REQUIRES. 

Officer JV "Lieutenant Dover, This is Maintenance Officer July Veldspar, might I request a smidgen of your time?

Lt Dover "Ew. Why are you talking like that?

Officer JV "Hehe, sorry I was just in a silly-goofy mood.

Lt Dover "I can tell, what do you want?

=== D3_JV_DJV === //Day 2, JV spoke to ducksly 
Officer JV "Let me tell you about this exchange I just had with this fool Ducksly.

Lt Dover "Wow, usually Ducksly is the one complaining about you.

Officer JV "Yeah well I guess it's about time I do so.

Lt Dover "Alright, I got nothing else going on so feel free to splurge.

Officer JV "Well it appears we've gotten in a bit of a prank war.

Lt Dover "Woah! I didn't know they had it in them. 

Officer JV "That's what I thought too! 

Officer JV "Fortunately, they're messing with a prank master!

Officer JV "The downside is they've gotten big feathers now, they think they are also some prank master. 

Lt Dover "Will JV's title as prank master to the up-and-coming rookie Emperor Ducksly?!

Officer JV "...Dover... Please...Look at me. What do you see?

*A dweeb.
*Someone who's ego is almost as bloated as Ducksly's.

-Officer JV "Aha ha ha... Shut up. 

Lt Dover "You asked. I answered hehe. 

Officer JV "I guess I could let this go one. It would definitely liven up the ship a bit more. What do you think Dover?

*A good bit of prank banter never hurt anyone.
~JV_Duck_relCount ++
*Put them in their place. You are the prank god.
~JV_Duck_relCount --

-Officer JV "Mmm Yes, you're right. I "m starting to get some ideas Mwahahaha!

Officer JV "Thanks Dover!

=== D3_JV_DB === //Day 2, JV spoke to Ducksly
Officer JV "Well I needed to find my tools from Ducksly but he didn't answer. And Baha is busy, I'm assuming speaking to Ducksly so...Here I am.

Lt Dover "Oh well, how are things going with you?

Officer JV "Eh it's ok. We're getting closer to the Edge and it's given me a lot to think about.

Lt Dover "I'm the undisputed prank Queen. But over the course of our journey, I don't know, I feel like everyone just see me as this silly quirky character on the ship.

*You are just a silly quirky character.
*You didn't just say silly and quirky in the same sentence.

-Officer JV "I don't mean to be this way.

Lt Dover "Did someone say this to you? Do I need to beat them up?

Officer JV "I mean I guess if you want to beat the Captain and Ducksly then go ahead.

*Let's rethink this. 
*Bring them on...

-Officer JV "I think after this I'm retiring.

Lt Dover "Woah.

Officer JV "I mean it's not like society will exist after we return. Do we even return after this?

Lt Dover "I don't know. That's above my paygrade.

Officer JV "I guess the question now is how do I break the news to Baha?

*I think you should defintely find some time to sit down with him.
~B_JV_relCount ++
*Don't tell him. Did he ever truly appreciate you?
~B_JV_relCount --
-Officer JV "You really think so?

Lt Dover "YoU rEaLlY tHiNk So? Why ask me if your just gonna ask that?

Officer JV "Sassy! Fair enough.

Officer JV "You've been a really good friend Dover. I'm so lucky to have you.

Lt Dover "Oh man, I'd hug you if you were here.

Officer JV "Give me a sec and I'll run over.
