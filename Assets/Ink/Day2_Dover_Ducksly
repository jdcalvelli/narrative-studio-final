//Day 2: Dover connects for a private conversation with Ducksly

//TORI NOTE: I'VE JUST GONE THROUGH AND SET UP THESE POST-CONVO VARIABLE DIVERTS, ALTER AS THE SCENE REQUIRES. 

Lt Dover "Let's see what ye Royal Highness wants now. #Dover

//SFX Ducksly being connected. 

Emperor Ducksly "Quackcelsior Lieutenant Dover, I hope you're doing well. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Oh, yeah, I'm alright. Thank you for asking, Ducksly! #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I'm sure you've heard about Officer J.V.'s recent prank on my centrifuges. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "She did what? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "A devilish ploy to hinder my work!

Lt Dover "Did you see her do that? Or is this just conjecture?

Emperor Ducksly "Of course not! She's crafty. 

Emperor Ducksly "No doubt she made sure to commit her prank while I was away from my station.

Lt Dover "That must be a really strong feeling if you didn't see her.

Emperor Ducksly "I can't believe that she would stoop so low as to monkey around with my equipment.

Lt Dover "Did you see her do that? Or is this just conjecture?

Emperor Ducksly "Of course not! But she admitted to it when you patched me through to her earlier.

Lt Dover "Oh, that'll do it. 

Emperor Ducksly "You should've seen the look on her face. She looked so pleased with herself.

Emperor Ducksly "Now while I was initialy upset, I mean how could I not when she directly impedes my research? Quack! #Ducksly
 
Emperor Ducksly "But now I see an opportunity has arisen. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "What did she even do to your- #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I've deduced that the cause of the Captain's high outlook of Officer JV is because of her adept skills at pranking!  #Ducksly

* Um, are you sure about that?
* I can't even begin to imagine how many ways this could go wrong. 

-Emperor Ducksly "Nonsense! I've already devised a foolproof plan.  #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "I'll play a prank on her that will outshine all of her pranks prior! #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "And the Captain will have no choice but to put me in his good graces. #Ducksly

*Ducksly, that's seriously not going to work out how you think it is. #Dover
*Have you ever even played a prank on someone before? #Dover

-Emperor Ducksly "QUACK! Oh ye of little faith! #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Now, I've got a couple of ideas that I've been ruminating on. #Ducksly

->Day2_DD_Continue1

=== Day2_Negative_JVD===

Emperor Ducksly Yes and I simply won't stand for it! I won't stand for it at all! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Jeez you make it sound like she destroyed the centrifuge. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "She might as well have! She's set my research back AT LEAST a day or two. #Ducksly 

*GASP! How will you recover from this?
*That monster!

-Emperor Ducksly "Exactly! I went to the Captain and he said he would have a stern talking to with her. Thank the Holy Bread Crumbs. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Yeah tampering with ship equipment is a big no no with the Captain. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "But you know something my non-avian friend? I don't think it's enough. I demand retribution. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "I'm going to give her a taste of her own medicine? #Ducksly

*Oh I didn't know she was sick!
->Dover_BadJoke
*You're going to prank her?

Emperor Ducksly "... #Ducksly

Lt Dover "I'm sorry. You just- You just set it up for me. I couldn't pass it down! #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I don't have time for your shenanigans! I'm trying to scheme my revenge prank! #Ducksly
->Day2_DD_Continue1

===Day2_DD_Continue1===
Lt Dover "Ok, what did you have in mind? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "The first is quite tame by prank standards. It simply would be 'hiding' her tools. #Ducksly
//taping an 'I"m Stupid' sign to her back.

Lt Dover "Wow, that is quite tame. I was worried there for a sec. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "The other, and I must say this one is delightfully devious. (Chuckles) #Ducksly
    //dubious

Lt Dover "Stop gassing yourself up and just tell me. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Are you ready? I'm going to jettison her tools out of the airlock. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "... #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "... #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Oh my god, you're serious? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I am completely serious. Which do you think I should do? #Ducksly

*Start off simple. Hiding her tools will show her.
~JV_Duck_relCount ++
*The tools, jettison them.

-Emperor Ducksly "Perfect! Thank you, Dover. Your help has proved most fruitful. I'll be sure to keep you updated. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Uh, yeah...happy to help. #Dover
