Officer JV "What's up, duck-breath? I'm kinda busy. #JV

Emperor Ducksly "Is that so? Pray tell, Officer Veldspar. What could you possibly be busy with? #Ducksly

Officer JV "Oh yeah know, nothing too important. Just making sure the ship doesn't explode and we don't get jettisoned from the Vespira. Casual stuff. #JV

Emperor Ducksly "...QUACK! #Ducksly

Officer JV "I'm just kidding Ducksly. Relax! I mean... I am actually doing that, but we're not in any 'immediate' danger. So, what's up? #JV

Emperor Ducksly "Well, I need to make a maintenance request. #Ducksly

Officer JV "Is it 'mission critical'? #JV

Emperor Ducksly "It's one of my centrifuges. Someone tampered with it, turned it into a slapdash blender. I wonder who could've - #Ducksly

Officer JV "So it's NOT mission critical? #JV

Emperor Ducksly "ALL my work is mission critical! #JV

Officer JV "Sorry Duck, Captain's orders. Anything not mission critical is bumped to the bottom of the maintenance request list. #JV

Emperor Ducksly "But my centrifuge! I need it for - #Ducksly

Officer JV "Your checklsit? #JV

Emperor Ducksly "Well, not necessarily... #Ducksly

Officer JV "Then sorry, bud. No can do. #JV

Emperor Ducksly "...QUACK! #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I KNOW you did it. #Ducksly

Officer JV "Did what? #JV

Emperor Ducksly "I know YOU tampered with with my centrifuge! Who else could've done it? #Ducksly

Officer JV "Are you sure it wasn't one of your medical staff? #JV

Emperor Ducksly "Oh, please! #Ducksly

Officer JV "It could have been someone trying to make a move on your position... #JV

Emperor Ducksly "... #Ducksly

Officer JV "Ha, I'm just messing with you, Ducksly. Yeah I did it! #JV

Emperor Ducksly "QUACK! #Ducksly

Officer JV "Sorry, I just wanted to mess with you a little bit. #JV
Officer JV "I can fix it, it's really not big a deal. #JV

Emperor Ducksly "Tell me something, Officer Veldspar. 
Emperor Ducksly "Are these pranks of yours why the Captain holds you in such high esteem? #Ducksly

Officer JV "What? #JV

Emperor Ducksly "The Captain appears to view you very highly. I never really understood why, but I'm curious if these pranks of yours are a cause. #Ducksly

Officer JV "...I - Yes that's exaclty why. 
Officer JV "Baha just loves my 'whimsical' nature. #JV

Emperor Ducksly "You're able to refer to the Captain by his first name... #Ducksly

Officer JV "I wish it was something as "intricate" as all that Ducksly. The Captain and I just go way back. #JV

Emperor Ducksly "Please... He even allows your little microgames to stay on the ship's software. #Ducksly

Officer JV "Wait, Ducksly, he know's about those? #JV

Emperor Ducksly "Whimisical nature, eh? You'll have to show me this sometime. #Ducksly

Officer JV "Ya know what? Sure. Game sees game. #JV

Emperor Ducksly "Why would you do something like that? #Ducksly

Emperor Ducklsy "You always do this. You know, every one of your pranks hinders my own work. #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "You only get away with this because the Captain views you so highly. #Ducksly

Officer JV "Dude chill, it's like 2 lines of code. I can literally come fix it right now. #JV

Emperor Ducksly "I'll never understand what the Captain sees in you. I'm smarter, more ambitious, and I don't go around breaking other people's equipment. #Ducksly

Officer JV "Hey... #JV

Emperor Ducksly "I'm stepping out from the lab for a little while. This had better be fixed when I return. #Ducksly
