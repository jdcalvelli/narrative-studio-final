//TORI SMITH - last worked 11/23

//DOVER connects JV to BAHA the Bridge on the switchboard.

Nothing much, as per usual. And sure thing. #Dover

'Preciate it. #JV

//SFX, line connecting and Baha picking up. 

Captain Baha speaking. #Baha

Captain Baha Blast.! It’s your favorite lead engineer. #JV

You’re the only lead engineer. #Baha

Ergo, your favorite. Got a minute to clear some pre-arrival checks? #JV

Copy. Go ahead. #Baha

Copy. Our daily perimeter checks and gear assessments are all squeaky clean... #JV

I’m sensing a “but”… #Baha

Captain, language! #JV

But…the steering gear’s being a bit sticky. #JV

“Sticky”, is that the technical term for it? #Baha

Oh absolutely. I need your “official permission” to cycle them through a cleaning and that oughta do the trick. #JV

My “official permission” huh? #Baha

You’ve already started it haven’t you? #Baha

Don’t touch the helm for the next hour or we’ll all explode and die. #JV

Copy that. #Baha

Wow, Baha Blast. what’re you gonna do with all this free time? Got any sappy prose you need my highly attuned literary opinion on? #JV

It’s not sappy… #Baha

Let’s goooooo… #JV

Keep your voice down. #Baha

Come on C.B., share your art with me! #JV

Maybe another time. Too many philistines on the bridge. #Baha

Careful, Baha. You’re starting to sound like Ducksly. #JV

God forbid. #Baha

//SFX: a clanging sound in the distance on J.V.’s end of the line.
What was that? #Baha

I gotta go. Steering will be back within the hour, everything’s fine! #JV

Vespira, hold on old girl. #Baha
