Cpt Baha "No well, I just spoke with J.V and I'm not sure what I'm feeling right now.

Lt Dover "How do you mean?

Cpt Baha "Well I decided I would share some of my writing with her. It's been something that I've been trying to open myself to doing more. 

Lt Dover "Well go on spill the details! How did it feel?

Cpt Baha "I'm not sure... that's why I'm here talking to you. 

Lt Dover "Ah...

Lt Dover "Sorry. Got caught up in the excitement?

Cpt Baha "I fail to see the excitement.

Lt Dover "That takes a lot of guts!

Cpt Baha "Is that so?

Cpt Baha "Either way, I'm beginning to understand that my taste in prose is a very specific taste.

*That's one way of putting it.
*I could've told you that.
