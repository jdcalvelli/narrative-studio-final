Lt Dover "Wonder what the Captain needs. #Dover

Cpt Baha "Lieutenant Dover, everything alright in the comm's room? #Baha

Lt Dover "Well you know...just patching people when need be. Homebase still doesn't pick up but that's to be expected. #Dover

Cpt Baha "Hmm good to hear.

Lt Dover "Is...Is that all you wanted to say to me Sir?

//Dover patches themselves to Captain Baha

//TORI NOTE: I'VE JUST GONE THROUGH AND SET UP THESE POST-CONVO VARIABLE DIVERTS, ALTER AS THE SCENE REQUIRES.

=== D2_B_JVB=== //Day 2, JV spoke to Baha

Cpt Baha "No well, I just spoke with J.V and I'm not sure what I'm feeling right now.

Lt Dover "How do you mean?

Cpt Baha "Well I decided I would share some of my writing with her. It's been something that I've been trying to open myself to doing more. 

Lt Dover "Well go on spill the details! How did it feel?

Cpt Baha "I'm not sure... that's why I'm here talking to you. 

Lt Dover "Ah...

Lt Dover "Sorry. Got caught up in the excitement?

Cpt Baha "I fail to see the excitement.

Lt Dover "That takes a lot of guts!

Cpt Baha "Is that so?

Cpt Baha "Either way, I'm beginning to understand that my taste in prose is a very specific taste.

*That's one way of putting it.
*I could've told you that.

-Cpt Baha "I guess, now that I think about it, it felt nice to be able open up like that.

Lt Dover "That makes sense, they say one's writing is a window into their sole!

Cpt Baha "I've not heard this quote, who said it?

Lt Dover "Oh... um...You know the name is slipping my mind right now.

=== D2_B_JVD === //Day 2, JV spoke to Ducksly
Cpt Baha "No well...See I've decided I would try to share my writing more. I was going to go to J.V...but-

Lt Dover "She didn't answer?

Cpt Baha "Hmm.

Lt Dover "Well I"m sure you'll be able to catch her some other time.

Cpt Baha "Perhaps your right. 

Lt Dover "But that's really exciting.

Cpt Baha "I can't help but think she's growing distant from me.

Lt Dover "What? Why do you say that?

Cpt Baha "I don't know maybe I'm just over thinking.

Cpt Baha "It shouldn't but this is very...mentally taxing for me.

Lt. Dover "I get it man, you're doing something you're not used to.

Lt. Dover "Just gotta try again and not let this whole thing get you down.

->DONE

Cpt Baha "Hmm...Tell me something Lieutenant, I'm approachable correct?

*I mean you don't give off creepy vibes.
*You're absolutely terrifying...

-Cpt Baha "I mean in a social manner. Over the course of our journey I've noticed most of the crew steers clear of me.

Lt Dover "We're talking right now in a 'Social Manner'.

Cpt Baha "Yes but I have to talk to you regularly.

Lt Dover "Oh Ok...Ouch?

Cpt Baha "I figured people seeing myself and J.V speaking would make me seem more approachable. 

Cpt Baha "Not that that's the only reason I speak to her.

Lt Dover "Look I think you making the inititative to share your writing is admirable!

Cpt. Baha "Thank you Lieutenant.

Lt Dover "But...

Cpt Baha "But?

//Positive relation w/ JV
*Maybe you should share your writing with everyone!
~ B_JV_relCount ++
//Negative relation w/ Jv
*You should stop relying on J.V to make you seem friendly.
~ B_JV_relCount --

-Cpt Baha "You really think so?

Lt Dover "Yeah! You got this Captain!

Cpt Baha "Thank you Lieutenant. 

Lt Dover "Calling people by their rank isn't going to make you seem more friendly.

Cpt Baha "I'm still your Captain. 

//Baha signs off.
