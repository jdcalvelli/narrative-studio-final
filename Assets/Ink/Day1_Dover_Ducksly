//Day 1: DOVER connects for a private conversation with DUCKSLY.

Lt Dover "Alright Dover, prep yourself. Let's see what Ducksly wants. #Dover

//Ducksly is patched. 

Emperor Ducksly "Quackcelsior! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "He- I mean Quackcelsior! #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Thank you for taking time to speak with me Dover. I wont take too much of your time. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "No worries, I've got nothing else going on anyways. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I'm sure. Something has recently troubled me and I wanted to run my thoughts past someone. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "And since you're the only here I remotely trust with something like this I figured that someone would be you. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Hmm. What's up. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "It's about my recent conversation with the Captain. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "As I'm sure you know I've been conducting physiological experiments on the crew. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Yessir. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Well after my conversation with the captain I've been instructed to abandon my projects and focus entirely on our arrival checkups. #Ducksly

*Oh no! Not your experiments! #Dover
*I think that makes sense. #Dover

-Emperor Ducksly "I could not disagree more with the Captain's request. I need him to understand the importantance of my experiments. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Well did you try to explain it to him? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Lieutenant Dover of course I- #Ducksly

Lt Dover "That wasn't in a condescending tone? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Quack! Of course not! I would never-#Ducksly

Lt Dover "Ducksly...You really smart and all, but sometimes your social skills are not all there. #Dover

Emperor Ducskly "Lieutenant I assure you I conveyed my displeasure to the Captain as suscinctinly and as respectfully as possible! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "I'm sure... #Ducksly

*Ever thought that maybe you guys are on the same page?
->Same_Page
*If Captain doesn't know, He can't be upset can he?
->Screw_It

===Same_Page ===
Emperor Ducskly "How do you mean? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Well your experiments are cnetered around monitoring our bodies over the course of the ship. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Actually it's studying the effects of prolonged faster than light travel on a biological entity's phsyio- #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Potato, potato Ducksly. #Dover

Lt Dover "And the Captain want's you to conduct health check ups before we reach our destination. #Dover 

Emperor Ducksly "Lieutenant if you're just going to repeat the obvious- #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Come on, You don't see where I'm going with this? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "hmm...Quack! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Smartest Duck in the galaxy. Come on Ducksly I set up the dots now you just need to connect them. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I'm really not following. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "You guys are literally wanting the same thing! #Dover

Lt Dover "You want to continue your experiments of studying the crew's bodies. #Dover

Lt Dover "The Captain wants you do health checks, ON OUR BODDIES. #Dover 

Emperor Ducksly "Ah, Quackcelsior! Lieutenant I see what you're summizing! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Finally. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Thank you, I'll be sure to explain to the Captain how our agendas align. #Ducksly

=== Screw_It ===
Emperor Ducksly "Are you suggesting that I subvert the Captain's orders? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "I would say subverting. You would still be following his orders, just not tellig him the other bits. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Hmm...This would result in a win-win scenario for myself and the Captain. #Ducksly
Lt Dover "Exactly. Everyone wins. If I were you I just wouldn't let thte Captain know. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "But isn't this grounds for treason? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "You're complying with the Captain. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Yes but- #Ducksly

Lt Dover "You are COMPLYING with the Captain. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "You're right. I won't question it further. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "It will be our little secret. #Dover
->Considering_JV

=== Considering_JV ===
Emperor Ducksly "If it's alright, might I run something else by you? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Sure what's up? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "It was to do with Officer Veldsapr. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Oh? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I'm sure you're aware of Officer Veldspar's relationship to the Captain? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Yeah of course, they go way back. #Dover

Lt Dover "What about it? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I quite frankly don't understand what the Captain sees in that bumbling slacker. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "She has no respect for chain of command. And she wastes time making nonsensical games with the ships systems. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "She played a prank on you didn't she? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Not recently...Quack! That's not the point! #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Regardless, when I was asking the Captian to continue my experiments, I have a strong feeling that if I were Officer Veldspar he would have allowed me to continue. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "I doubt that. They migh be close but when the Captain wants something done, it usually gets done. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I'm just having a hard time understanding what the Captain sees in her. #Ducksly 

//VARIABLe here determines, JV-ducksly relationship for next day
* Maybe you should try getting to really know J.V?
~ JV_Duck_relCount ++ //improves jv_duck Relationship
*Reprimand her to the Captain.
~ JV_Duck_relCount -- //hinders jv_duck relationship
    //JV_Ducksly --

-Emperor Ducksly "Perhaps you're right.  #Ducksly

Lt Dover "I mean what else do you have to lose. #Dover 

Emperor Ducksly "This will be new to me. But if it means I'll understand what the Captain sees in her, then so be it. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Thank you again Lieutenant Dover. Your assistance is appreciated. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Happy to help! #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Quackcelsior! #Ducksly
