//Ducksly is patched in.
//SFX, line connecting.

Emperor Ducksly "Quackcelsior! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "He- I mean Quackcelsior! #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Thank you for taking time to speak with me, Dover. I wont take too much of your time. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "No worries, it's not like I've got anything else going on. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I'm sure. Something has troubled me recently  and I wanted to run my thoughts past a kind ear. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Since you're the only humanoid here I remotely trust with something like this, I figured that kind ear might as well be you. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Thanks...what's up? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "It's about my recent conversation with the Captain. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "As I'm sure you know I've been conducting physiological experiments on the crew. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Right... #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Well, after my conversation with the Captain I've been instructed to abandon my projects and focus entirely on our arrival checkups. #Ducksly

* Not your experiments!!! #Dover
    Emperor Ducksly "QUACK! #Ducksly
* I think that makes sense. #Dover

- Emperor Ducksly "I could not disagree more with the Captain's request. I need him to understand the importantance of my experiments. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Did you try to explain it to him? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Lieutenant Dover, of course I- #Ducksly

Lt Dover "In a non-condescending tone? #Dover

Emperor Ducskly "Lieutenant, I assure you I conveyed my displeasure to the Captain as succinctly and respectfully as possible! #Ducksly

* Have you ever considered that maybe you guys are on the same team? #Dover

Emperor Ducskly "How do you mean? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Your experiments are centered around monitoring our bodies over the course of the ship - #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Actually, it's studying the effects of prolonged exposure to faster than light travel on a biological entity's phsyio- #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Potayto, potahto, Ducksly. #Dover

Lt Dover "And the Captain wants you to conduct health check ups before we reach our destination. #Dover 

Emperor Ducksly "Hmmmmmm...Quack! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Smartest Duck in the galaxy...

* Come on, Ducksly. I set up the dots, now you just need to connect them. #Dover //give him one last chance 
    Emperor Ducksly "I'm really not following. #Ducksly 
* You guys literally want the same thing! #Dover //cut to the chase

- Emperor Ducksly "Oh! Eure-quack! Lieutenant, I see now what you are summarizing! #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Finally. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Thank you, I'll be sure to explain to the Captain how our agendas truly align. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "That's not what I - # Dover
Lt Dover "Oh, whatever." #Dover

-> DONE

=== D1_D_WorsenDBH ===
Emperor Ducksly "Are you suggesting that I subvert the Captain's orders? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "I wouldn't say 'subverting'. You'd still be following his orders, just not telling him...the other bits. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Hmm...This could result in a mutually victorious scenario... #Ducksly

* "Exactly. Everyone wins.
* "But..if I were you, I wouldn't tell the Captain. #Dover

- Emperor Ducksly "But, could this be construed as treason? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "You're complying with the Captain. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Yes, but- #Ducksly

Lt Dover "You are 'COMPLYING' with the Captain. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "QUACK. You're right. I won't question your un-feathered wisdom further. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "It will be our little secret. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "(whispering) Quackcelsior! #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "It was to do with Officer Veldsapr. #Ducksly
Emperor Ducksly "I'm sure you're aware of Officer Veldspar's relationship to the Captain? #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Sure, they go way back. #Dover
Lt Dover "What about it? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I quite frankly don't understand what the Captain sees in that bumbling slacker. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "No respect for chain of command. Wastes time making nonsensical games with the ships systems - #Ducksly

Lt Dover "She played a prank on you didn't she? #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Quack! That's not the point! #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Regardless, when I was asking the Captian to continue my experiments, I have a strong feeling that if I were Officer Veldspar he would have allowed me to continue. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "I doubt that. They migh be close but when the Captain wants something done, it usually gets done. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "I'm just having a hard time understanding what the Captain sees in her. #Ducksly 

//VARIABLe here determines, JV-ducksly relationship for next day

*Reprimand her to the Captain.

    //JV_Ducksly --

-Emperor Ducksly "Perhaps you're right.  #Ducksly

Lt Dover "I mean what else do you have to lose. #Dover 

Emperor Ducksly "This will be new to me. But if it means I'll understand what the Captain sees in her, then so be it. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "Thank you again Lieutenant Dover. Your assistance is appreciated. #Ducksly

Lt Dover "Happy to help! #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "Quackcelsior! #Ducksly
