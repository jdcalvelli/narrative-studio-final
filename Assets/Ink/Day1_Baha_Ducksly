//DOVER connects DUCKSLY to BAHA the Bridge on the switchboard.

No problem, Duck-arino. #Dover

<i>quack</i> Please, don’t call me that. #Ducksly

//SFX, line connecting and Baha picking up.

Quackcelsior Captain! #Ducksly

Mhm. What can I do for you Ducksly? #Baha

Captain, we’ve been over this. When someone greets you with Quackcelsior you’re supposed to- #Ducksly

//Baha interrupts
Ducksly, please get on with it. #Baha

//stuttering
Oh. Um. Well. Right.<i>quack<i> #Ducksly

I was looking over the pre-arrival check-list you sent out and I noticed there was an item for medical check-ups on the crew. #Ducksly

And? #Baha

Well, it's just that the equipment that I would need is currently in use. #Ducksly

Used for what? #Baha

Well, as our science officer, since our mission departure I thought I would be fruitful to conduct a bit of research. #Ducksly

That’s nice and all, but we’re about to arrive. I’m sure you can spare some equipment from your “non-regulated research”. #Baha

But, Captain! We’ve been traveling faster than light for the better part of a galactic year on our way to the Edge! How many species get to experience life at such speed? What does that do to a species' physiology? #Ducksly

That’s fascinating Ducksly, it truly is. But - #Baha

Exactly, Captain! <i>I</i> could be the first to know what happens to life at this scale. If I were to redistribute the equipment at this juncture, it would - #Ducksly

Ducksly, please just get the medical checks done. #Baha

Again, Captain, think of how our bodies all might’ve changed just over these few months. #Ducksly

Ducksly! That’s not our mission. I’m sorry to say but your research is going to have to be put on pause. #Baha

Captain, please I must ask you to reconsider! This is important to <i>me</i>, just as much as our mission is. #Ducksly

How many times do I need to say this: but it’s not just about you. I need those check ups done. Alright? #Baha

If J.V asked for some equipment for some smooth-brained project, you wouldn’t hesitate to grant her leniency! #Ducksly
    //This is the sickest burn, I just wanna call that out. 
    
//A beat
How about you let Officer Veldspar worry about her portion of the check-list and you worry about yours, Officer Ducksly. Get those checks <i>done</i>. #Baha

//A beat
Of course captain. Signing off- #Ducksly

And Ducksly... #Baha

Hm? #Ducksly

The crew doesn’t just need these check ups. I need them. Ok? #Baha

Yes Captain. #Ducksly

-> DONE
