Lt Dover "No problem, Duck-arino. #Dover

Emperor Ducksly "QUACK. Please, don’t call me that. #Ducksly

//SFX, line connecting and Baha picking up.

Emperor Ducksly "Quackcelsior, Captain! #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Mhm. What can I do for you Ducksly? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Captain, we’ve been over this. When someone greets you with "Quackcelsior" you’re supposed to- #Ducksly

//Baha interrupts
Cpt Baha "Ducksly, I don't have all day. #Baha

//stuttering
Emperor Ducksly "Oh. Um. Right. QUACK. #Ducksly

Emperor Ducksly "I was looking over the pre-arrival checklist you sent out and I noticed there was an item for medical check-ups on the crew. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "And? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Well, it's just that the equipment that I would need is currently in use. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Used for what? #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Well, as our science officer, and since our mission departure, I thought it would be fruitful to conduct a bit of research... #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "That’s nice and all, but eminent arrival takes priority. I’m sure you can spare some equipment from your “non-regulated research”. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "But, Captain! We’ve been traveling faster than light for the better part of a galactic year on our way to the Edge! How many species get to experience life at such speed? What does that do to a species' physiology? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "That’s fascinating, Ducksly, it truly is. But - #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Exactly, Captain! I could be the first to know what happens to life at this scale! If I were to redistribute the equipment at this juncture, it would - #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Ducksly, please just get the medical checks done. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "But think of how our bodies might’ve changed just over these few months - #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "Yes, but that’s not our mission. I’m sorry to say it, but your research is going to have to be put on the back burner. #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Captain, PLEASE. I must ask you to reconsider! This is just as important to me as our mission. #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "It's not about YOU. I need those check ups done. Alright? #Baha

//like it's under his breath but he wants Baha to hear
Emperor Ducksly "If J.V asked for some equipment for some smooth-brained project, you wouldn’t hesitate to grant her leniency... #Ducksly
    //"smooth-brained" is the sickest burn, I just wanna call that out. 
    
//A beat
Cpt Baha "How about you let Officer Veldspar worry about her portion of the checklist and you worry about yours, Officer Ducksly. Get those checks DONE. #Baha

//A beat
Emperor Ducksly "...Of course, Captain. Signing off - #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "And Ducksly... #Baha

Emperor Ducksly "Hm? #Ducksly

Cpt Baha "The crew doesn’t just need these check ups. I need them. Ok? #Baha
//this line still isn't reading for me, the intention isn't quite clear. I'd like to revisit

Emperor Ducksly "Yes, Captain. #Ducksly
